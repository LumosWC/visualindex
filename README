VisualIndex is a simple MATLAB and VLFeat-based demo of a system that
can index an image collection and enable visual queries.

To run the demo, make sure that VLFeat is contained in a subfolder of
the VisualIndex package directory and that it is compiled. Then open
MATLAB and issue

> demo_visualindex

to automatically download the Oxford building dataset and start
running demo queries. The indexing process takes a while, but can
acclerated by opening a matlabpool (see MATLABPOOL()).
